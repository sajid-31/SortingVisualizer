# SortingVisualizer
### Visualization of various array based sorting algorithms.
Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! This application was created out of my fascination with sorting algorithms and my desire to see them in action. I hope you find as much enjoyment in exploring and using this visualization tool as I did in developing it. You can access it here (best viewed in Google Chrome!): https://sajid-31.github.io/SortingVisualizer/
